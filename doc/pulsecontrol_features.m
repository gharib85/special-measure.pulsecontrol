%% Special Measure Pulsecontrol Features
%
% Special Measure Pulsecontrol can be used to:
%
% * create pulses for Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) instruments on
% different levels of sophistication.
% * mange pulses as groups in a sequence on one or several AWGs at once.
% * mirror AWG states inside MATLAB(R), adjust global offset and other
% calibration parameters for optimized pulse generation.
% * backup AWG content changes for automatic documentation purposes.
% * mange pulses in a global pulse database (|plsdata|).
% * examin pulses from |plsdata| graphically before upload to an AWG.
